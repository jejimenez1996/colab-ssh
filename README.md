## What is Colab-ssh ?
Colab-ssh is a light-weight library that enables you to connect to a Google Colab virtual machine using an SSH tunnel.

> <details><summary> <b> Can I open the Colab notebook automatically without user interaction ?</b> </summary>No, you still need to open the Google Colab Notebook interface manually in order to setup this tool. Google Colab doesn't have an API yet to automatically run a notebook for you.</details>

> :warning: Colab-ssh supports Google colaboratory notebooks only, using it on other notebooks may lead to unexpected behavior. 

## Getting started

1. Open Google Colab and run this code in one of the code cells
```jupyter
# Install colab_ssh on google colab
!pip install colab_ssh --upgrade

from colab_ssh import launch_ssh_cloudflared
launch_ssh_cloudflared(password="<PUT_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE>")

```
> Make sure you replace `<PUT_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE>` with a password of your choice

The output of this snippet will look similar to the following screenshot:
